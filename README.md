# fumenizer
Creates a Fumen ( http://fumen.zui.jp#english.js ) diagram from an image of the playfield. Do not include the border.

Usage: fumenizer.py {image file}

For now this only generates the javascript needed to inject into a fresh Fumen page and copies it to the clipboard.
You also have to prepend a 'j' yourself for security reasons.
